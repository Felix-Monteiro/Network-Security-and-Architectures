# Network Security and Architectures
These projects were done in the Advanced Network Security and Architectures course. The primary purpose was to study the principles and techniques for designing and managing secure network infrastructures in isolated environments using GNS3.

## Project 1 Network Attacks and Countermeasures
Report: [`Network Attacks & Mitigations`](Project_1.pdf)

Config File: Configurations inside the report in Annex 

This report discusses some network vulnerabilities and countermeasures. It also explains the steps to reproduce such attacks, the steps to prevent them, and some theoretical concepts necessary for understanding them.

### Topics:
* CAM table overflow
* DHCP Spoofing
* ARP poisoning (MitM)
* Root Bridge spoofing (MitM)
* DNS spoofing
* RIP poisoning
* DNS spoofing using DHCP spoofing

# Project 1 Firewalls
Report: [`Firewalls`](Project_1.pdf)

Pages: 41-68

Config File: Configurations inside the report in Annex

This project discusses Firewalls architectures and types. With further investigation regarding Firewalls in campus networks, ZBPF versus classical firewalls and their influence on DoS attacks.

### Topics:
* Classical firewalls versus Zone-Based Policy Firewalls
* Protecting a campus network using a ZBPF
* Defence against DoS attacks

# Project 1 AAA
Report: [`AAA`](Project_1.pdf)

Pages: 68-82

Config File: Configurations inside the report in Annex

This project discusses AAA, which stands for Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (basically, it is a framework used to control who is permitted to use the network resources - authentication - what they are authorized to do - authorization - and capture the actions performed while accessing the network - accounting).

### Topics:
* AAA with TACACS+
* 802.1X Authentication
