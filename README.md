## Project 1 Network Attacks and Countermeasures
Report: [`Network Attacks & Mitigations`](Project_1.pdf)
Config File: Configurations inside the report in Annex 

This report discusses some network vulnerabilities and countermeasures. It also explains the steps to reproduce such attacks, the steps to prevent them, and some theoretical concepts necessary for understanding them.

### Topics:
* CAM table overflow
* DHCP Spoofing
* ARP poisoning (MitM)
* Root Bridge spoofing (MitM)
* DNS spoofing
* RIP poisoning
* DNS spoofing using DHCP spoofing
